- now post setting the acsurl i am facing a redirection loop, for context this is the order of execution : of the current request: the user goes to the target url, from there he does a get request to target/saml/authenticate/x now the service provider gets to the identity provider with the saml request, and the idp post to the in target url/saml/sso but post that the user again gets to target/saml/authenticate/x.. so this same cycle repeats, let me know if you also want the flow pre migration to the new spring-boot version which was working earlier — [Updated on 2025-02-22 11:34:13](https://hyp.is/1z-IKPDiEe-O9cuz_eEUhg/chatgpt.com/c/67b33248-91f4-800e-823b-c3006ac20cc2) — Group: #me-only

- pre-migration flow: the user request the target url , next the service provider does a get request to the identity provider(saml) to which the identy provider responds with the saml to the target/saml/sso next the user is redirected to the target url successfully — [Updated on 2025-02-22 11:34:18](https://hyp.is/2jM5ivDiEe-YZ_-s2zyxzg/chatgpt.com/c/67b33248-91f4-800e-823b-c3006ac20cc2) — Group: #me-only

- n your case, your IdP (Azure) is posting the SAML response to a URL (like /saml/sso) that doesn't match what Spring Security expects. As a result, Spring Security isn’t picking up the authentication, and it keeps redirecting back to the authentication endpoint—hence the loop. — [Updated on 2025-02-22 11:34:27](https://hyp.is/31jmHPDiEe-x1PtUlvkdWQ/chatgpt.com/c/67b33248-91f4-800e-823b-c3006ac20cc2) — Group: #me-only

- When you migrate to the new version, Spring Security automatically sets up the default ACS endpoint as:bashCopyEdit/login/saml2/sso/{registrationId} — [Updated on 2025-02-22 11:34:37](https://hyp.is/5U74DvDiEe-_gsfyftZOmQ/chatgpt.com/c/67b33248-91f4-800e-823b-c3006ac20cc2) — Group: #me-only
