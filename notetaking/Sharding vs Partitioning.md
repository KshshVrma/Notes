Sharding is done in such a manner that there are different database servers, for eg for different reigions, whereas partitioning the database is dividing the database into chunks and storing them, both cases make the db candidate for indexing.

sharding is at the database level and partitioning is at a data level 

so now for eg you have 2 database servers in which the new data has been partitioned between the two database.
