[[Encoding and Decoding]]


1. **Using a Hardcoded Encrypted Value:**  
    Yes, you can use a hardcoded encrypted value as a Python constant and insert it into the database. For example, if you already know the encrypted value of `"123456789"`, you can define it as a constant in your Python code. However, you must ensure that this constant is in the correct **binary format** (i.e., a byte string) since the database column is of type **BLOB**.
    
2. **Impact of Encoding Differences (UTF-8 vs ISO-8859):**  
    In your product, encryption is done using **UTF-8**, but the user-copy tool uses **ISO-8859**. This difference can be important because:
    
    - **Encryption and Decryption:** The encryption process converts plain text to cipher text (binary data). If your hardcoded encrypted value was generated using UTF-8, then the bytes represent that encrypted data.
    - **Storing into a BLOB:** Since a BLOB stores binary data, the database itself does not care about text encoding. However, the encoding matters when you are converting a string into bytes or vice versa.
    - **Consistency is Key:** If your hardcoded constant is defined as a byte string in Python (for example, using a `b''` literal) and was generated using UTF-8, then you must ensure that any other component that reads or writes the encrypted data uses the same encoding method.
    - **Mixing Encodings:** If the user-copy tool takes an ISO-8859 string and then you convert it without care, you might end up with a different byte sequence than expected. This could lead to issues when the application later tries to decrypt the value.

### **Practical Example**

Suppose you have a hardcoded encrypted value generated using UTF-8 (and then encrypted by Google Tink or any other mechanism). You might define it in Python as follows:


HARDCODED_ENCRYPTED_VALUE = b'\x8a\xbc\x45\xde...'  # example bytes; use your actual value

import cx_Oracle

# Connect to your Oracle database
conn = cx_Oracle.connect("username/password@DB")
cursor = conn.cursor()

# Insert the hardcoded encrypted value into the BLOB column
cursor.execute(
    "INSERT INTO users (username, password) VALUES (:1, :2)",
    ('test_user', HARDCODED_ENCRYPTED_VALUE)
)

Now, consider the encoding issue:

- **If the constant is defined as a text string:**  
    For example, if you mistakenly define it as a Unicode string (e.g., `HARDCODED_ENCRYPTED_VALUE = "some_text"`), you must convert it to bytes.
    
    - If you know it was originally generated using UTF-8, then convert using `.encode("utf-8")`.
        
    - If for some reason the user-copy tool provides a string in ISO-8859, then convert it as follows:
    iso_string = "some_iso_encoded_value"
# First, decode it from ISO-8859 to get a Unicode string, then encode it to UTF-8 (if that's what your decryption expects)
converted_bytes = iso_string.decode("iso-8859-1").encode("utf-8")
