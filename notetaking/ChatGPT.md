- Yes, the Spring Security library automatically handles the ACS URL via its SAML processing filter in both the old and new setups. The key difference now is the default URL pattern, which means you need to ensure your IdP’s ACS URL is updated to match Spring Boot 3’s expectations. This alignment is essential to avoid redirection loops and to successfully process the SAML response. — [Updated on 2025-02-22 16:44:40](https://hyp.is/NbXrYPEOEe-pRIeC5SnO1g/chatgpt.com/c/67b33248-91f4-800e-823b-c3006ac20cc2) — Group: #me-only

- Yes, exactly. In your previous setup, you didn’t need an explicit controller or request handler for the ACS (Assertion Consumer Service) URL because Spring Security automatically registered a SAML processing filter to handle incoming SAML responses. The filter intercepted requests to the ACS URL (for example, /saml/sso) and processed them—this is why your application worked without a custom handler. — [Updated on 2025-02-22 16:44:51](https://hyp.is/PB23WPEOEe-g_G-qh_NCJg/chatgpt.com/c/67b33248-91f4-800e-823b-c3006ac20cc2) — Group: #me-only

- Old Configuration:In the earlier versions, Spring Security’s SAML extension automatically mapped the ACS endpoint (like /saml/sso) to a filter. This filter read the SAML response posted by the IdP, validated it, and then established an authenticated session.Spring Boot 3 / Spring Security 6 Changes:The default endpoints have been updated. Now, the ACS endpoint is automatically set to:bashCopyEdit/login/saml2/sso/{registrationId} — [Updated on 2025-02-22 16:45:25](https://hyp.is/UFHHtPEOEe-CR3-bIOihXA/chatgpt.com/c/67b33248-91f4-800e-823b-c3006ac20cc2) — Group: #me-only
