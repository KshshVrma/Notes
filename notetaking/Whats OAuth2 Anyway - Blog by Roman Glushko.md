## Page Notes
## Highlights
- is a framework that defines how access or permissions are requested or delegated from one an authoritative entity (like the user) to third-party applications — [Updated on 2025-01-31 21:49:09](https://hyp.is/GY8KZN_vEe-qk48-eAOjXA/www.romaglushko.com/blog/whats-aouth2/) — Group: #me-only

- The core idea behind OAuth2 is to give users the power to decide what applications (beyond those that are natively supported by the resource server) can access their data. It ensures that the access is controlled and convenient, allowing these applications use your data whenever they need to, even when you’re not around, to extend the base functionality of the resource server. — [Updated on 2025-01-31 21:49:23](https://hyp.is/IlhSGN_vEe-yvmsadgk1og/www.romaglushko.com/blog/whats-aouth2/) — Group: #me-only

- Without mechanisms like OAuth2, the resource server essentially controls which applications can access with your data — [Updated on 2025-01-31 21:49:28](https://hyp.is/JRU9ct_vEe-j9ROi3BcUWw/www.romaglushko.com/blog/whats-aouth2/) — Group: #me-only

- OAuth2 introduces a middle ground, allowing the third-party applications to use the resource server, as long as users are willing to grant permissions to their data or functionality. — [Updated on 2025-01-31 21:49:39](https://hyp.is/K39rJN_vEe-qP_cLPiwFvA/www.romaglushko.com/blog/whats-aouth2/) — Group: #me-only

- OAuth2 introduces the Authorization Server, acts as a middleman between the Resource Owner (who has the authority) and the Client Application (that needs some of that authority). The Authorization Server is trusted by the target Resource Server (which provides some functionality based on the authority). The Client Application asks the Resource Owner for a certain set of permissions to access the Resource Server. — [Updated on 2025-01-31 21:50:54](https://hyp.is/WFJNdN_vEe-gnlu27CnX1g/www.romaglushko.com/blog/whats-aouth2/) — Group: #me-only

- The Resource Owner reviews the permission request and gives a consent to grant the access to the Client Application via the Authorization Server. — [Updated on 2025-01-31 21:51:04](https://hyp.is/XnMN7N_vEe-lGg9I3O_r7A/www.romaglushko.com/blog/whats-aouth2/) — Group: #me-only

- Depending on the authorization flow, the Client Application receives an authorization grant in some form and uses it to trade for an access token (or a pair of tokens) from the Authorization Server. Finally, the Client Application uses the access token to access the Resource Server on behalf of the Resource Owner. — [Updated on 2025-01-31 21:51:29](https://hyp.is/bV7UCN_vEe-9Bj-7pFKjaw/www.romaglushko.com/blog/whats-aouth2/) — Group: #me-only
