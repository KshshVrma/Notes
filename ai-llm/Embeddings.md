these are numerical vaues assigned, so that system can understand.
for eg if the emotions are happy, normal, sad,
then embeddings store the values as vectors, and that is how it can do operations like

document comparision
search engine
recommendation systems, etc

to use it we can use numpy, which can take embedding scores and based on that do comparision, and can give a similarity score
